# What-Is-This-Thing-I-Found
You found one of my devices that has this URL on it.  

You are probably concerned it is some tracking device or something Nefarious.   Fear not!  it is a device designed to make your's and other people's lives easier.

My devices are built around NFC (Near Field Communication) technology and its primary focus is to make it easier to read NFC devices with your phone or other items.  You may have found this on an ATM, or a Gas Station.  it just means that a normal person had issues reading their tap to pay device, or their credit card with the card reader.  They placed my device on the unit to be able to use it more efficiently.  

It does not record information.  It isnt capable of anything other than strengthening the field that is used to read key fobs or cards.

Hope that explains it and settled any nerves.
